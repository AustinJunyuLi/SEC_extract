## Resolved rules

### §Scope-1 — Research scope: corporate takeover auctions (🟩 RESOLVED, 2026-04-18)

The research target is **corporate takeover auctions**, per Alex's collection
guide (`reference/CollectionInstructions_Alex_2026.pdf`) §1–§2.1:

> "Collect detailed bidding data on corporate takeover auctions … Criterion:
> multiple bidders have signed/executed confidentiality agreements."

**Definition of an auction (deal-level classification).** A deal qualifies as
an auction when **≥ 2 non-advisor bidders signed confidentiality agreements
during the current sale process**. Formally:

```
count({row ∈ events :
         row.bid_note == "NDA"
         AND row.role == "bidder"
         AND row.process_phase >= 1}) >= 2
```

Exclusions, per Alex:
- `role == "advisor_financial"` or `"advisor_legal"` rows do NOT count
  toward the threshold (per `rules/bids.md` §M3).
- `process_phase == 0` (stale prior) rows do NOT count toward the
  threshold (per `rules/events.md` §L1 / §L2).

**Pipeline behavior — Option B (extract-then-classify).** The extractor runs
on **every** deal with a valid filing type (see §Scope-2). No pre-gate. Each
deal emits a deal-level boolean `auction` computed from the extracted NDA
events. Non-auction deals receive full extractions; the research dataset is
filtered downstream on `auction == true`.

**Why Option B, not a pre-gate.**
1. The auction criterion is an *output* of the extraction (it depends on the
   extracted NDA count), so pre-gating would require a second pass.
2. Non-auction extractions cost the same per-deal budget and may be useful as
   negative controls, diagnostics, or for future research questions.
3. `auction` becomes a validator-checkable deal-level invariant (did the
   classifier see ≥2 qualifying NDAs?) — harder to do if the gate sits
   outside the pipeline.

**Schema implication.** `auction: bool` is a deal-level field (see §N1 when
that resolves — `deal` object either way).

**Validator implication.** A new deal-level invariant is implied: `auction`
must agree with "≥2 non-advisor bidder NDAs in the current process." Filed
under `rules/invariants.md` as a future §P-D*; flagged here as a pending
addition.

**Cross-references.**
- `rules/events.md` §L1 — definition of "stale prior process."
- `rules/bidders.md` §F2 — `bidder_type` classification needed to exclude
  financial-advisor NDAs from the auction count.
- `rules/invariants.md` — new deal-level check pending.

---

### §Scope-2 — Accepted filing types (🟩 RESOLVED, 2026-04-18)

The skill accepts four **primary substantive form types**, per Alex's
collection guide §1:

| Form | Filed by | Background section title | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **DEFM14A** | Target | "Background of the Merger" | Definitive merger proxy — the workhorse. |
| **PREM14A** | Target | "Background of the Merger" | Preliminary merger proxy. Accepted iff a matching DEFM14A is NOT available; if both exist, prefer DEFM14A. |
| **SC TO-T** | Acquirer | "Background of the Offer" | Tender-offer cover form. The narrative is in the **Offer to Purchase** exhibit (`EX-99.(A)(1)(A)`), which `scripts/fetch_filings.py` auto-resolves. |
| **S-4** | Acquirer | "Background of the Merger" | Stock-consideration mergers; Background often appears in the target's proxy section incorporated by reference. |

**Amendments** (`/A` suffix) are accepted **only when they supersede** a primary
filing — i.e., when the amendment itself contains a full restatement of the
Background. A bare amendment that only modifies a schedule or disclosure is
ignored (no Background to extract). Operationally: the fetcher prefers the
latest `/A` when its size is comparable to the primary; otherwise it falls
back to the primary.

**Target-side tender-offer companions** (`SC 14D9`, `SC 14D9/A`) are accepted
as a **secondary** source for a deal already covered by an `SC TO-T`. The
target often tells its side of the story in 14D9, complementing the
acquirer's narrative in the TO-T / Offer to Purchase. When both are present
for the same deal, extract each into its own `output/extractions/{slug}.json`
run and reconcile downstream (a future Stage-3+ concern; MVP picks ONE, the
richer of the two, and flags `paired_filing_not_extracted` on the deal).

**Explicitly excluded** (not Background-bearing):
- `DEFA14A` — definitive additional materials; soliciting content only.
- `425` — merger communications; press-release-style.
- `SC 13D` / `SC 13G` — beneficial-ownership filings.
- Stand-alone `8-K` announcements — event-date only.

**Deal-level `FormType` field.** The extracted deal carries the form type that
sourced the Background, e.g. `"FormType": "SC TO-T (via EX-99.(A)(1)(A))"` for
tender offers so the validator and downstream analyst can see which substantive
document was read.

**Fail-loud rule.** If `seeds.csv` points to a URL whose form type is NOT in
the accepted list, the pipeline marks the deal `status: failed` with
`notes: "unsupported_form_type: <type>"` and moves on. The seeds file is
never silently rewritten.

**Why these four.** Alex's collection guide §1 explicitly enumerates them.
The 401 seed URLs in `seeds.csv` were drawn from the legacy Chicago dataset,
which used the same four. Expanding the form list is a research-design
decision for Alex — out of scope for MVP.

**Cross-references.**
- `scripts/fetch_filings.py` — `PRIMARY_FORM_TYPES` and tender-offer exhibit
  chasing via `OFFER_TO_PURCHASE_EXHIBIT_PATTERN`.
- `rules/schema.md` §Scope-1 — auction classification operates *after* form
  filtering.

---

### §Scope-3 — Fields the AI deliberately does NOT produce (🟩 RESOLVED, 2026-04-18)

The AI extractor reads the filing's Background section and nothing else. It
does NOT produce:

**Category A — external-database fields (downstream merge only):**
- `cshoc` — COMPUSTAT shares outstanding. A panel field, not in the filing.
- `gvkey` / `gvkeyT` / `gvkeyA` — COMPUSTAT firm identifiers. Not in filings.

**Category B — EDGAR metadata (fetcher owns):**
- `DateFiled` — the date the document was filed with the SEC. Available from
  EDGAR's index HTML. `scripts/fetch_filings.py` will be extended to write
  this to `data/filings/{slug}/manifest.json` as `source.date_filed`. The AI
  does not re-derive it.
- `FormType` — the EDGAR form-type label. Already written by the fetcher as
  `manifest.source.form_type` (e.g., `"DEFM14A"`, `"EX-99.(A)(1)(A)"`). AI
  copies it through into the output's deal-level field but does NOT
  re-classify the document.
- `URL` / `primary_url` — filing URLs. Copied through from
  `manifest.source.index_url` and `source.primary_document_url`.
- `CIK`, `accession` — EDGAR identifiers. Already in `manifest.json`; copied
  through if needed.

**Category C — orchestration metadata (pipeline owns, not extraction):**
- `DealNumber` — Alex's legacy workbook row-group identifier. The pipeline
  keys on `slug` (from `seeds.csv`); any downstream step that needs the
  legacy `DealNumber` can join on `slug`.
- `rulebook_version` — the git SHA of `rules/` at extraction time. Written
  by `run.py` into the output's `deal` object, not by the AI.

**Category D — behaviors the skill does not do:**
- Fetch external data (SEC EDGAR beyond the filing itself, COMPUSTAT,
  news sources, etc.).
- Rewrite or merge with `reference/deal_details_Alex_2026.xlsx`.
- Classify the form type or resolve tender-offer exhibits (that's
  `scripts/fetch_filings.py`'s job, per §Scope-2).
- Assign new `BidderID` values across deals; `BidderID` is within-deal only.

**What the AI DOES produce from the filing (pending §R1 for the full list):**
1. The event array (the main product).
2. A deal-level `auction: bool` computed from extracted NDA events (per
   §Scope-1).
3. **Confirmation** of deal-identity fields read from the filing's cover /
   proxy summary: `TargetName`, `Acquirer`, `DateAnnounced`, `DateEffective`.
   If the filing-read value disagrees with the corresponding field in
   `seeds.csv` / `manifest.json`, emit a flag `deal_identity_mismatch` on the
   deal; the output carries the **filing-read** value (filing is ground
   truth per `CLAUDE.md`).
4. `all_cash` — pending §N2 decision (may belong to AI or downstream).

**Validator implication.** A new row-level check is implied: the deal-level
identity fields emitted by the AI must either match `manifest.json` or carry
a `deal_identity_mismatch` flag. Filed for `rules/invariants.md` pending §R1.

**Cross-references.**
- `rules/schema.md` §R1 — final column set (will formalize which of the
  "does produce" items are required vs optional).
- `rules/schema.md` §N1 — deal-level vs event-level split.
- `rules/schema.md` §N2 — `all_cash` derivation.
- `scripts/fetch_filings.py` — adds `source.date_filed` to `manifest.json`
  (pending; not yet implemented).
- `CLAUDE.md` — "ground-truth epistemology" section.

---

### §R1 — Final column set (🟩 RESOLVED, 2026-04-18)

Output shape: one JSON file per deal, `{deal: {...}, events: [...]}` (see §N1).

**`deal` object — AI-produced fields (reads from filing):**
- `TargetName` — string. Filing-read; flag `deal_identity_mismatch` if disagrees with seeds.
- `Acquirer` — string. Same.
- `DateAnnounced` — ISO date. Same.
- `DateEffective` — ISO date OR null. Null if filing predates closing.
- `auction` — bool. Computed per §Scope-1 from extracted NDA events.
- `all_cash` — bool. Per §N2, AI-derived from consideration structure.
- `target_legal_counsel` — string OR null. Per `rules/events.md` §J2.
- `acquirer_legal_counsel` — string OR null. Per `rules/events.md` §J2.
- `bidder_registry` — object. Maps canonical `bidder_NN` → `{resolved_name, aliases_observed, first_appearance_row_index}`. Populated by extractor after events. Per `rules/bidders.md` §E3.
- `go_shop_days` — int OR null. Per `rules/bids.md` §O1.
- `termination_fee` — float OR null. USD. Per `rules/bids.md` §O1.
- `termination_fee_pct` — float OR null. As % of deal value. Per `rules/bids.md` §O1.
- `reverse_termination_fee` — float OR null. USD. Per `rules/bids.md` §O1.

**`deal` object — orchestration fields (`run.py` writes, not AI):**
- `slug` — from `seeds.csv`.
- `FormType` — from `manifest.source.form_type`.
- `URL` — from `manifest.source.index_url`.
- `primary_document_url` — from `manifest.source.primary_document_url`.
- `CIK`, `accession` — from manifest.
- `DateFiled` — from `manifest.source.date_filed` (pending fetcher addition).
- `rulebook_version` — git SHA of `rules/` at extraction time.

**Fields DROPPED from Alex's legacy 35-col workbook (per §Scope-3):**
- `gvkeyT`, `gvkeyA` — COMPUSTAT firm IDs. Downstream merge.
- `cshoc` — COMPUSTAT panel field. Out of scope (§N3).
- `DealNumber` — legacy Chicago row-group ID. Pipeline keys on `slug`.

**`events[]` — per-row columns (kept from Alex's legacy except as noted):**
- `BidderID` — int or decimal (per `rules/dates.md` §A, pending).
- `process_phase` — int. `0` = stale prior, `1` = main, `2` = restart (per `rules/events.md` §L2).
- `role` — string. `"bidder" | "advisor_financial" | "advisor_legal"`. Defaults to `"bidder"`. Auction classifier (§Scope-1) filters `role == "bidder"`. Per `rules/bids.md` §M3.
- `exclusivity_days` — int OR null. Exclusivity period granted at this bid event. Per `rules/bids.md` §O1.
- `financing_contingent` — bool OR null. Per `rules/bids.md` §O1.
- `highly_confident_letter` — bool. Default false. Per `rules/bids.md` §O1.
- `process_conditions_note` — string OR null. Free text for conditions not structured above. Per `rules/bids.md` §O1.
- `bidder_name` — string. **Canonical deal-local ID** (`bidder_01`, `bidder_02`, …)
  per `rules/bidders.md` §E3. Stable across all rows for the same entity.
- `bidder_alias` — string. Filing's verbatim label for this bidder on this
  row (`"Party A"`, `"Pfizer Inc."`, `"Strategic 1"`). Per `rules/bidders.md` §E3.
- `bidder_type` — **structured object** `{base, non_us, public}` where
  `base ∈ {"s", "f", "mixed"}`, `non_us: bool`, `public: bool`.
  REPLACES Alex's 4 booleans (`bidder_type_financial` / `_strategic` /
  `_mixed` / `_nonUS`) + `bidder_type_note`. Per `rules/bidders.md` §F1.
- `joint_bidder_members` — `list[str]` OR null (iter-4 addition;
  documented iter-5). Canonical `bidder_NN` ids of consortium
  constituents, for rows that represent a joint-bidder group event.
  Populated ONLY when the row represents a consortium / joint bidder:
  (a) the single `Executed` row when the merger-agreement counterparty
      is a consortium (per `rules/bidders.md` §E2.a; e.g.,
      `["bidder_06", "bidder_07"]` for CSC/Pamplona on mac-gray);
  (b) an aggregated `NDA` row when the filing narrates the consortium's
      NDA as a single group event (per `rules/bidders.md` §E2.b);
  (c) aggregated `Bid` or `Drop` rows when the filing narrates them
      jointly for a consortium (per §E2).
  Null / absent on all non-consortium rows and on per-constituent rows
  in cases where the filing narrates each constituent separately. The
  field order is: the canonical id of the merger-agreement counterparty
  first (where applicable), then the other constituents in filing
  narrative order. Ids must exist in `deal.bidder_registry`.
- `bid_note` — string from closed vocabulary (§C1, pending).
- `bid_type` — `"formal" | "informal" | null` (per §G1).
- `bid_date_precise` — ISO date OR null.
- `bid_date_rough` — natural-language phrase OR null.
- `bid_value` — numeric OR null. Aggregate $ amount when `bid_value_unit = "USD"`; otherwise reserved.
- `bid_value_pershare` — numeric OR null. Per-share headline value. Per `rules/bids.md` §H1.
- `bid_value_lower` — numeric OR null. Per-share range lower bound. Per `rules/bids.md` §H1.
- `bid_value_upper` — numeric OR null. Per-share range upper bound. Per `rules/bids.md` §H1.
- `bid_value_unit` — string. `"USD_per_share"` for per-share bids; `"USD"` for aggregate (§H4); currency codes (e.g., `"EUR"`) for non-USD.
- `cash_per_share` — numeric OR null. Cash component of composite consideration. Per `rules/bids.md` §H2.
- `stock_per_share` — numeric OR null. Stock component valued at bid date. Per `rules/bids.md` §H2.
- `contingent_per_share` — numeric OR null. CVR / earnout component. Per `rules/bids.md` §H2.
- `consideration_components` — list[str]. Ordered components present (e.g., `["cash", "cvr"]`). Per `rules/bids.md` §H2.
- `aggregate_basis` — string OR null. `"enterprise_value"` / `"equity_value"` / `"purchase_price"` / `null`. Only populated when `bid_value` is aggregate. Per `rules/bids.md` §H4.
- `additional_note` — string OR null.
- `comments` — string OR null. **Collapses** Alex's legacy `comments_1` /
  `comments_2` / `comments_3` into one free-text field.
- `source_quote` — str OR list[str] (§R3).
- `source_page` — int OR list[int] (§R3).
- `flags` — array of flag objects (§R2).

**Net change count from Alex's 35 cols:**
- 7 drops (gvkeyT, gvkeyA, cshoc, DealNumber, and Auction/FormType/URL move
  to `deal` from row-level).
- 5 booleans collapsed into 1 `bidder_type` string (net −4 cols).
- 3 comments cols collapsed into 1 (net −2).
- 3 new per-row cols: `source_quote`, `source_page`, `flags` (+3).

**Cross-references.**
- `rules/bidders.md` §F1 — `bidder_type` canonical string format.
- `rules/schema.md` §R2 — `flags` structure.
- `rules/schema.md` §R3 — `source_quote` / `source_page` contract.
- `rules/schema.md` §N1 — `{deal, events}` split rationale.
- `rules/schema.md` §N2 — `all_cash` derivation.

---

### §R2 — Flags column format (🟩 RESOLVED, 2026-04-18)

Each row carries `flags: list[FlagObj]`. `FlagObj` is:

```json
{
  "code": "date_inferred_from_rough",
  "severity": "hard | soft | info",
  "reason": "phrase: 'mid-July 2015'"
}
```

- `code` — short snake_case identifier. Enumerated in `rules/invariants.md`
  (validator-generated) and in extractor procedure (extractor-generated).
- `severity` — one of `"hard"`, `"soft"`, `"info"`. Hard = blocks the deal
  from advancing past `status: validated`. Soft = logged, no block. Info =
  statistical anomaly.
- `reason` — one-line human-readable string. For extractor-generated flags,
  name the trigger (e.g., `"phrase: 'mid-July 2015'"`). For validator flags,
  name the check that failed (`"source_quote_not_in_page: cited page 34"`).

**Deal-level flags** live in a parallel `deal.deal_flags[]` array of the same
shape (see `prompts/validate.md`).

**State log.** Every flag is ALSO appended to `state/flags.jsonl` by the
pipeline, with deal slug + row index, for cross-deal analysis. Row-level
`flags[]` in the JSON output is the in-place copy for human review.

**Rejected: plain-string array.** Loses `severity` and `reason`; reviewer
has to grep the rulebook to know if a flag is blocking.

**Rejected: separate severity-indexed dict** (`hard_flags[]` / `soft_flags[]`).
Harder to serialize consistently; structured objects are trivially filterable.

---

### §N1 — Deal-level vs event-level split (🟩 RESOLVED, 2026-04-18)

Output is `{deal: {...}, events: [...]}`. Deal-level fields appear **once**
in the `deal` object, NOT repeated on every row.

Legacy Excel layout (where every row carries `TargetName`, `Acquirer`, etc.)
would be generated by a separate downstream export step if Alex's analysis
scripts need it. The current repo stops at JSON extraction and does not
provide a `run.py --rebuild-excel` entrypoint.

**Validator implication.** Drops `§P-D9` ("deal-level fields consistent
across rows") — no longer applicable since deal fields exist once. Replaced
with `§P-D9' (pending): deal-level fields present and non-null`.

**Rationale.** JSON-native; avoids 16× duplication per deal; matches the
natural extraction structure (scan once for deal-level identity, then scan
linearly for events).

---

### §N2 — `all_cash` derivation (🟩 RESOLVED, 2026-04-18)

AI derives `all_cash: bool` from the merger-agreement summary paragraph
(typically on the filing cover or the "Merger" / "Summary Term Sheet"
section).

**Decision rule.**
- `all_cash = true` iff consideration is **pure cash** per share.
- `all_cash = false` for any composite, contingent, or non-cash consideration:
  cash + CVR, cash + earnout, cash + stock, pure stock, mixed cash/stock
  election, etc.
- If the filing's description is ambiguous (rare), flag
  `all_cash_ambiguous` (severity: soft) and emit the AI's best guess.

**Evidence.** Like every row, the deal-level `all_cash` carries
`source_quote` and `source_page` citing the consideration paragraph. These
go on the `Executed` row's existing quote rather than duplicating at the
deal level.

**Interaction with §H2 (composite consideration, pending).** The composite
schema decided in §H2 determines how cash + CVR / cash + earnout is
represented in the `events[]` rows. `all_cash` is downstream of that — any
composite makes `all_cash = false`.

---

### §N3 — `cshoc` source (🟩 RESOLVED, 2026-04-18)

**Out of scope.** AI does not produce `cshoc`. Downstream merge on `gvkey`
against COMPUSTAT. Confirms and formalizes the general rule in §Scope-3.

Alex's "to be verified" note → the COMPUSTAT join is the right place to
verify; filing-read share counts (e.g., "as of the Record Date, X shares
were outstanding") can serve as a cross-check but are not emitted as
`cshoc` by the extractor.

---

### §R3 — Evidence column (🟩 RESOLVED, 2026-04-18)

Every event row carries two mandatory evidence fields that cite the filing text
it was extracted from. These are the backbone of manual verification and the
hard-fail line of the validator.

**Fields.**
- **`source_page`** — `int` OR `list[int]`. The sec2md-assigned page number(s),
  as stored in `data/filings/{slug}/pages.json[i].number`. **NOT** the filing's
  printed page number, which may disagree with sec2md's pagination; sec2md's
  numbering is what the validator can verify against.
- **`source_quote`** — `str` OR `list[str]`. Verbatim substring(s) of the
  `content` field of the cited page(s). Each string must appear byte-for-byte
  (after Unicode NFKC normalization) inside the corresponding page's `content`.

**Single-quote form** (used for ~95% of rows):
```json
{ "source_page": 34, "source_quote": "On June 29, 2016, Medivation and Pfizer entered into a customary confidentiality agreement …" }
```

**Multi-quote form** (used only when one paragraph is insufficient — typical
for `bid_note = Executed` rows that cite both the announcement and the merger
agreement):
```json
{ "source_page": [34, 127], "source_quote": ["…announcement quote…", "…execution quote…"] }
```

When multi-quote, `source_page` and `source_quote` must be lists of the same
length; element `i` of `source_quote` must appear on page `source_page[i]`.

**Length constraint.** A single `source_quote` string is one paragraph at most
— bounded by the blank-line breaks sec2md emits. Hard cap: **1000 characters
per string**. If more evidence is needed, split into a list rather than
lengthening a single quote.

**Validator check (hard error).** `rules/invariants.md` §P-R1 enforces:
1. `source_quote` non-empty.
2. `source_page` is a valid page number for the deal's `pages.json`.
3. After NFKC normalization, `source_quote` is a substring of
   `pages[source_page - 1].content`.
4. In multi-quote form, all four lists/elements align.

Violation → flag `source_quote_not_in_page`. The row is still emitted (per
SKILL.md "not rewritten, only annotated") but the deal cannot advance past
`status: validated` until resolved.

**Reproducibility.** `source_page` values are stable only within a given sec2md
version. `data/filings/{slug}/manifest.json` records `sec2md_version`. Pin
sec2md in `requirements.txt` before shipping Stage 3. Upgrading sec2md
requires re-fetching or accepting page-drift on old extractions.

**Rationale over rejected alternatives:**
- *Filing's printed page number.* Not every filing HTML aligns to printed
  pages; and Austin can't programmatically verify a printed page number exists.
- *Character offsets (start/end positions).* More precise, but brittle under
  whitespace normalization and hard to spot-check by eye.
- *Paragraph hashes.* Overengineered for MVP; substring check catches both
  hallucinated and paraphrased quotes.

**Cross-references.**
- `SKILL.md` §Non-negotiable rules (mandatory for every row).
- `rules/invariants.md` §P-R1 (hard validator check).
- `scripts/fetch_filings.py` (produces `pages.json` the quotes must live in).

## Open questions

### §Scope-1 — Which deals does the skill handle?
- 🟩 **RESOLVED** — see top of this file. Research scope: corporate takeover auctions. Pipeline extracts every valid-filing-type deal and emits a deal-level `auction: bool`; downstream filters on `auction == true`.

### §Scope-2 — Which filing types are accepted as input?
- 🟩 **RESOLVED** — see top of this file. Accepted: DEFM14A, PREM14A, SC TO-T, S-4 (primary substantive). `/A` amendments accepted when they supersede. `SC 14D9` accepted as secondary companion to `SC TO-T`. `DEFA14A` / `425` / `8-K` / `13D` / `13G` excluded.

### §Scope-3 — What does the skill deliberately NOT produce?
- 🟩 **RESOLVED** — see top of this file. AI excludes: COMPUSTAT fields (`cshoc`, `gvkey*`), EDGAR metadata (`DateFiled`, `FormType`, `URL`, `CIK`, `accession`), and orchestration metadata (`DealNumber`, `rulebook_version`). AI produces: event array, `auction`, confirmed deal-identity fields (flags mismatches with seeds).

### §R1 — Final column set the AI emits
- 🟩 **RESOLVED** — see top of this file. Structure `{deal: {...}, events: [...]}`. Alex's 4 bidder_type booleans → single `bidder_type` string. 3 comments cols → single `comments`. 3 new cols: `source_quote`, `source_page`, `flags`. 7 cols dropped per §Scope-3.

### §R2 — Flags column format
- 🟩 **RESOLVED** — see top of this file. Structured array of `{code, severity, reason}` objects. Deal-level flags in parallel `deal.deal_flags[]`. Every flag also appended to `state/flags.jsonl`.

### §R3 — Evidence column
- 🟩 **RESOLVED** — see top of this file.

### §N1 — Deal-level vs event-level split
- 🟩 **RESOLVED** — see top of this file. `{deal: {...}, events: [...]}`. Deal fields appear once, not repeated per row.

### §N2 — `all_cash` derivation
- 🟩 **RESOLVED** — see top of this file. AI derives `all_cash` from consideration structure. `true` iff pure cash; `false` for any composite. Composite representation pending §H2.

### §N3 — `cshoc` source
- 🟩 **RESOLVED** — see top of this file. Out of scope for AI; downstream COMPUSTAT merge on `gvkey`.

Still-open field semantics:
- `BidderID` format (int vs decimal) — `rules/dates.md` §A1.
- `bid_date_precise` vs `bid_date_rough` rules — `rules/dates.md` §B1–B4.
- `bid_note` closed vocabulary — `rules/events.md` §C1.
- `bidder_type` canonical string format — `rules/bidders.md` §F1.
- `bid_type` informal/formal decision rule — `rules/bids.md` §G1.
- `bid_value*` structure for ranges/single-bound — `rules/bids.md` §H1.
- Composite-consideration representation — `rules/bids.md` §H2.

The shape above is the contract; the still-open items above fill in the
semantics of individual fields without changing the shape.
